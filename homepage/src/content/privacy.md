# Privacy

## TL;DR

Auralous is a privacy-friendly application. No üôà monkey business!

- ü§ù We never share your information (We don‚Äôt even have much anyway)
- üíØ We use [privacy-friendly analytics](https://usefathom.com/).
- üç™ We have **zero** cookies that track you.
- üëª You can easily delete **all** of your data at any time.

The privacy of your data ‚Äî and it is your data, not ours! ‚Äî is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here‚Äôs what that means in practice:

## Identity & access

Sign up is not required to use [auralous.com](https://auralous.com/) (the ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù). When you do, we ask for only your profile photo and email provided by third-party accounts. Your email is **never** visible to others across the Application. That‚Äôs just so we can send you updates on your stories and other lovely updates. We‚Äôll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won‚Äôt use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission, either. You are free to delete your information at any time, and we make it at your best comfort in doing so.

### Geolocation data

We do not keep any logs such as IP address and time of access or analyze and track your usage by any means.Web analytics data ‚Äî described further in the Website Interactions section ‚Äî are also tied temporarily to IP addresses.

Some features require the retention of _approximate_ geolocation information. However, it is **never** visible to others across the application and is only used the provide the application experiences.

### Website interactions

When you browse our application, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using.

### Voluntary correspondence

When you write Auralous with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.

### Information we do not collect

We don‚Äôt collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity,gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily,such as if you include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support team.

We also do not collect any biometric data. You are given the option to add a picture to your user profile,which could be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that represents you best.We do not extract any information from profile pictures: they are for your use alone.

## Location of Site and Data

This Application is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

## Your Rights With Respect to Your Information

You may have heard about the General Data Protection Regulation (‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù) in Europe. GDPR gives people under its protection certain rights with respect to their personal information collected by us on the Site. Accordingly, Auralous recognizes and will comply with GDPR and those rights, except as limited by applicable law. The rights under GDPR include: Right of Access, Right to Correction, Right to Erasure, Right to Complain, Right to Restrict Processing, Right to Object, Right to Portability, and Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. Data isn‚Äôt encrypted while it‚Äôs live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.

## When you delete data in your accounts

When you deactivate your account, we‚Äôll ensure that nothing is stored on our servers immediately. Anything you delete on your account while it‚Äôs active will also be purged immediately. We do not have backups of our application databases, but if we do in the future, they are kept for up to 30 days. Retrieving data for a single account from a backup is cost-prohibitive and unduly burdensome so if you change your mind you‚Äôll need to do so before your data are deleted from our active servers.

## Changes & questions

Auralous may update this policy once in a blue moon ‚Äî we‚Äôll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time in [settings](https://auralous.com/settings).
